Clusters weighted (x, y) coordinates using k-means clustering

The data represents the location of a client and the priority (weight) that the client has. The goal of k-means clustering is calculate the coordinates to place servers in the center of k clusters of clients, so that the average squared Euclidean distance between a client and server are minimized.
